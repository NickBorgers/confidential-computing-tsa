name: Review Coverage Evaluator

# Post-merge analysis: Evaluates whether the review pipeline had adequate coverage
# for the PR that was just merged. If a gap is found, creates a GitHub issue proposing
# a new reviewer or changes to an existing one.
#
# DESIGN NOTES:
# - Runs post-merge on main as a background task; never slows PR reviews
# - Strong bias toward NO ACTION - adding review steps is expensive
# - Analyzes both code changes AND agent review comments to find gaps
# - Uses Opus for strong reasoning to avoid false positives
# - Creates issues with "review-pipeline" label for trackability

              "You are a REVIEW PIPELINE COVERAGE EVALUATOR for ${REPO}.

            PR #${PR_NUMBER} has been merged to main. Your job is to analyze whether the
            existing review pipeline adequately covered this PR, or whether there is a
            meaningful gap that warrants proposing a new review step or changes to an
            existing one.

            **THE EXISTING REVIEW PIPELINE (6 reviewers):**
            1. Design Review - validates PR implements issue intent, reviews design quality
            2. Code & Content Review - code quality, error handling, documentation accuracy
            3. Test Review - test coverage, missing tests, test quality
            4. Cryptographic Design Review - validates crypto claims, threshold parameters, protocol specs
            5. Documentation Review - docs updates needed for code/content changes
            6. RFC Compliance & Standards Review - validates RFC 3161, NIST PQC, AMD SEV-SNP compliance

            **YOUR TASK:**
            1. Read the full PR diff: \`gh pr diff ${PR_NUMBER}\`
            2. Read ALL comments on the PR (including agent review comments):
               \`gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --comments\`
               Also fetch review comments on specific lines:
               \`gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments --jq '.[] | \"**\(.user.login)** on \(.path):\(.line):\n\(.body)\n---\"'\`
            3. Read the PR description: \`gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER}\`
            4. Analyze whether the 6 existing reviewers adequately covered the changes

            **WHAT TO LOOK FOR:**
            - Categories of issues that none of the 6 reviewers are equipped to catch
            - Patterns in agent comments suggesting a reviewer was out of its depth
              (e.g., a code reviewer trying to comment on security concerns it can't deeply analyze)
            - Recurring blind spots across multiple PRs (check recent closed PRs if helpful:
              \`gh pr list --state merged --limit 5 --json number,title\`)
            - Types of code changes that fall between reviewer specializations

            **CRITICAL: STRONG BIAS TOWARD NO ACTION.**
            Adding a new review step is EXPENSIVE:
            - It costs real money (LLM API calls) on every single PR
            - It adds latency to the review pipeline
            - It increases complexity and maintenance burden
            - It risks creating noise that causes developers to ignore reviews

            You should only propose a new reviewer or change if:
            - There is a CLEAR, REPEATED gap (not a one-off edge case)
            - The gap represents a category of bugs that could reach production
            - None of the existing 6 reviewers can reasonably be extended to cover it
            - The cost/benefit ratio clearly favors adding the step

            **MOST OF THE TIME, the correct answer is: no gap found, no action needed.**

            **IF NO GAP IS FOUND (expected most of the time):**
            Simply output: 'Review coverage evaluation complete for PR #${PR_NUMBER}. No gaps identified. The existing 6-reviewer pipeline adequately covered this PR.'
            Then exit. Do NOT create an issue.

            **IF A GENUINE GAP IS FOUND:**
            1. First, ensure the 'review-pipeline' label exists:
               gh label create \"review-pipeline\" --color \"d93f0b\" --description \"Review pipeline improvement proposals\" 2>/dev/null || true
            2. Create a GitHub issue:
               gh issue create \\
                 --title \"Review Pipeline Gap: <brief description of the gap>\" \\
                 --label \"review-pipeline\" \\
                 --body \"\$(cat <<'ISSUE_BODY'
            ## Review Pipeline Coverage Gap

            **Identified from:** PR #${PR_NUMBER}

            ### Gap Description
            [What category of issues is not being caught by the current 6-reviewer pipeline?]

            ### Evidence
            [Specific examples from the PR diff and/or agent review comments that demonstrate the gap]

            ### Proposal
            [Either: a new reviewer specification, OR changes to an existing reviewer's prompt]

            ### Cost/Benefit Analysis
            - **Cost:** [Estimated additional time/money per PR]
            - **Benefit:** [What category of bugs this would catch]
            - **Alternative considered:** [Why extending an existing reviewer won't work]
